# The art of PostgreSQL

# Learning Domain-Driven Design

Really interresting overview of DDD.
My main take away woudl be that:
- You don't have to apply everything from DDD, you can choose which one
- Port and adatper, clean arch, onion arch are more or less the same
- Nice summary of different pattern: Transaction script, active record, domain model, event sourcing
- Event sourcing is a nice way to discover domain knowledge even in non DDD project

# High Performance Networking

Quite interresting books, explains some very practical impact of networking on your application.
One example is that the latency (rtt time) in TCP will limit your throughput due to the size of the sequence windows.

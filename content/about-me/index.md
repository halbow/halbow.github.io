# Hi, I'm Halbow !

I'm an Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience ! I've mainly worked in high growth Startups
and Scale-ups, where I've held position of Senior Backend Software Engineer and Tech Lead/Lead Engineers !

### Main focus of interest:

- **Python Web development**: I've been building scalable web application with Python for the majority of my career

- **Software Architecture**: I have extensive experience with clean architecture and domain-driven design (DDD)

- **Devops**: I'm a strong advocate for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployement (CI/CD) and believe they have a strong impact on a company's productivity

### Some open-source project I created:

- [Atomik](https://github.com/halbow/atomik): Manipulate folder/files in an atomic way with context manager in Python
- [Structify](https://github.com/halbow/structify): Rust-like structure in Python

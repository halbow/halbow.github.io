      <title>100% coverage or not</title>

      <description>ðŸ§µThe debate Whether targeting 100% coverage is worth it or not has been a long discussion in Software Engineering. For some people it&amp;rsquo;s very well worth the time to test everything while some other argue that it&amp;rsquo;s not worthwile to invest that much time and that some 80% or 90% is good enough. While it&amp;rsquo;s clearly a significant amount of work to reach this kind of threshold on a legacy/non-trivial codebase, I recently had to start a new project from scratch and asked myself the question: should I bother to aim for 100% coverage or should I settle for an arbitrary threshold like 90% ?</description>

      <title>Syscall in Python</title>

      <description>What is a Syscall ? ðŸ”Ž Syscall are the main way for program to communicate with the Operating System. Program usually run in userspace and are limited in the action they can do. For safety reason many low level actions are handled by the kernel. As soon as you want to do something meaningful (print something to stdout, read something from a hard drive, send something on the network, etc) you have to make a syscall to communicat with the kernel to do it.</description>

      <title>Composition and Dependency Injection</title>

      <description>Back at Europython this year, I attended this very good talk on composition by Hynek Schlawack, which clicked on many level with how I code nowadays. I was never a huge fan of oriented object programming and inheritance in particular. I really recommend to watch the talk if you feel the same ! But I recently learned that when trying to apply composition together with dependency injection, things can become a bit more complex ðŸ˜¶</description>

      <description>Pytest is a great library and has become my default choice for any testing I have to do in Python. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to start with it, just create some function starting with test_ containing some assert inside a file and run pytest on this file. Pytest will auto-discover the test function and run it, providing a detailed explanation in case of failure !
However, there&amp;rsquo;s one small pitfall I noticed several times during code review, which is the following usage:</description>
